      "opticNerveOriginFunction": "Origination: diencephalon. Function: sensory, vision.",
      "opticNerveExamSteps": "The exam includes: 1) Snellen for Visual Acuity, 2) Color Vision, 3) Visual Fields by confrontation, and 4) Fundoscopic exam.",
      "visualFieldsConfrontationTechnique": "During visual fields by confrontation, the examiner closes their left eye to compare the field of their right eye with the patient's left eye. The assumption is that the examiner has normal visual fields, so both should see the fingers at roughly the same distance.",
      "opticNeuritis": "Cause: Inflammation, often autoimmune (e.g., multiple sclerosis). Features: central vision loss.",
      "ischemicOpticNeuropathy": "Cause: Vascular insufficiency (e.g., from giant cell arteritis, diabetes, hypertension). Features: Sudden painless vision loss, pale and swollen optic disc.",

      "ptosisDefinition": "Ptosis is the medical term for drooping of the eyelid.",
      "directConsensualPupillaryResponse": "The basic light reflex test involves shining a light in one eye and observing direct constriction in that eye and consensual constriction in the opposite eye. It confirms that both the afferent (CN II) and efferent (CN III) pathways are functioning in each eye but does not compare the strength of the afferent input between them.",
      "swingingFlashlightTestPurpose": "This is a dynamic comparison test. You swing the light back and forth between eyes every 2-3 seconds, watching how the pupils respond. It is used to detect a Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect (RAPD), which means one eye's optic nerve is transmitting less light information than the other. A standard direct/consensual test might miss this asymmetry.",
      "swingingFlashlightTestSteps": "1. Dim the room lights. 2. Ask the patient to fixate on a distant target. 3. Shine a light into one eye for 2-3 seconds. 4. Quickly swing the light to the other eye. 5. Repeat several times, observing direct and consensual pupillary responses.",

      "accommodationDefinition": "Accommodation is the mechanism by which the eye changes its refractive power by altering the shape of the lens to focus on objects at variable distances.",
      "accommodationTest": "To test accommodation, hold your finger about 10cm from the patient's nose. Ask them to alternate looking into the distance and at your finger. Observe the pupillary response in each eye.",
      "accommodationNormalResponse": "Normally the pupils are dilated while looking into the distance and constricted when looking at your finger.",
      "convergenceDefinition": "Convergence is the coordinated inward movement of both eyes toward each other, allowing you to focus on objects that are close to your face.",
      "convergenceTest": "To test convergence, ask the patient to follow your finger or a pencil as you move it in toward the bridge of the nose.",
      "convergenceNormalResponse": "The converging eyes normally follow the object to within 5cm to 8cm of the nose.",
      "accommodationConvergenceCNIII_Mechanism": "CN III enables accommodation and convergence by: 1. Adjusting the lens via the ciliary muscle. 2. Causing pupil constriction (miosis) via the sphincter pupillae muscle. 3. Adducting the eyes by contracting the medial rectus muscles.",
      "diabeticOculomotorPalsy": "Diabetic Oculomotor Palsy is caused by microvascular ischemia, commonly spares the pupil, and presents with ptosis, diplopia, and a 'down and out' eye position.",

      "adiesTonicPupilPathophysiology": "Adie's Tonic Pupil is caused by postganglionic parasympathetic denervation with aberrant regeneration, resulting from damage to postganglionic parasympathetic fibers from the ciliary ganglion in the CN III pathway.",
      "argyllRobertsonPupil": "Argyll Robertson pupils are small, irregular pupils that do not constrict to light but constrict briskly to near stimuli (accommodation) and fail to dilate in the dark. The near response is brisk, not tonic like in Adie's pupil.",
      "argyllRobertsonPupilMechanism": "The mechanism is a midbrain lesion (often from neurosyphilis) affecting the pretectal nuclei, which are involved in the afferent limb of the light reflex. The CN III efferent pathway is intact, but central integration of the light reflex is impaired.",
      "oculomotorPalsyPresentation": "Clinical presentation of oculomotor palsy includes ptosis (drooping eyelid), a 'down and out' eye position (from unopposed CN VI and IV action), diplopia, mydriasis (dilated pupil if parasympathetic fibers are involved), and impaired accommodation.",

      "vestibularNystagmus": "Peripheral vestibular nystagmus has horizontal and rotary components and is suppressed by visual fixation. It improves with gaze toward the lesion and worsens with gaze to the opposite side. Central nystagmus is more variable and unaffected by fixation.",
      "gazeEvokedNystagmus": "Gaze-evoked nystagmus occurs when a patient holds their gaze in a certain location. It is most often induced by ethanol or drugs. If vertical movement is present, it often indicates brainstem and/or cerebellar disease.",
      "downBeatNystagmus": "Down-beat nystagmus, when present on down-and-out gaze, is suggestive of a lesion at the Foramen Magnum, such as a Chiari malformation.",
      "abducensPalsyDescriptionTitledCN4": "Abducens Palsy (incorrectly titled as CN IV Palsy) affects the lateral rectus muscle. When CN VI is impaired, the eye drifts inward (esotropia).
